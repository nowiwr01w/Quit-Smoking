# Quit Smoking
Here you can see how I write code in production.

Please note that I had no final idea of what the application would look like. I'm not a designer, but I have compiled and implemented the design entirely by myself.

* Design: Only ME
* Animations: Only ME
* Logic: Only ME

If you want to help me with the design, you can feel free to write to me in telegram: @nowiwr01
